# Harris-Corner-Detection-and-HOG-Feature-Extraction
This project implements two core vision techniques: Harris Corner Detection and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG). By leveraging gradient information, we capture and visualize local image structures. These fundamental methods are used to extract interpretable features for tasks like object recognition and detailed image analysis.
